I’m tracking how `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE` differs between the host and container, and planning to set it conditionally for act to ensure the cache is found correctly, likely switching to `/opt/acttoolcache` inside the container to align with act’s default. This should help avoid unnecessary ffmpeg reinstalls by matching the tool-cache lookup path with the seeded cache location."}}
