`/home/deck/.local/bin/act`.\\n- `make actions-list` and `make actions-test` completed successfully.\\n- Added `.dockerignore` to keep build context small for the Docker image.\\n- `make actions-vhs` now builds the image but fails in `charmbracelet/vhs-action`: `Failed to install ffmpeg`.\\n- Workflow now seeds ffmpeg via `apt` and sets tool-cache envs, but the action still tries to download ffmpeg via GitHub API and fails under `act`.\\n- `git push` to `origin main` succeeded.\\n\\n## What to do next\\n1) Provide a GitHub token to `act` so vhs-action can fetch the ffmpeg release, e.g.:\\n   - `make actions-vhs ACT_FLAGS=\\\"--bind -s GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN\\\"`\\n2) Re-run `make actions-vhs`.\\n3) If the GIF was generated/committed locally, check `git status` and push if needed.\\n4) Build and run the mock Proxmox container: `make mock-proxmox-build` then `make mock-proxmox-run`.\\n5) Run discovery against the mock SSH endpoint: `CHECK_HOSTS=\\\"root@localhost\\\" SSH_OPTS=\\\"-p 2222\\\" make discovery-full`.\\n6) If using MicroK8s, deploy the mock manifests and port-forward SSH as described in `mock/proxmox/README.md`.\\n\\n## Testing and packaging (next steps)\\n- Testing: add a smoke test that runs discovery against the container mock and verifies non-empty outputs in `discovery/latest/`.\\n- Testing: wire a CI job to build the mock image and run discovery with `SSH_OPTS=\\\"-p 2222\\\"` against localhost.\\n- Packaging: publish the mock image to a registry (e.g., `ghcr.io/realagiorganization/proxmox-mock`) and update K8s manifests to reference it.\\n- Packaging: add a versioned release tag and a changelog entry when the mock image is published.\\n\\n## Notes\\n- The VHS workflow will generate `assets/archlinux-kde.gif` and auto-commit it via GitHub Actions.\\n\"}}\n./.codex/sessions/2026/01/02/rollout-2026-01-02T14-39-34-019b7eb8-6ef1-7a42-8335-4f94ccd8821a.jsonl:197:{\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-02T13:14:17.265Z\",\"type\":\"response_item\",\"payload\":{\"type\":\"function_call_output\",\"call_id\":\"call_hjNBLlW3nsyVxVVHT0JKGfht\",\"output\":\"Exit

SSH_OPTS=\\\"-p 2222\\\" make discovery-full`  \\n  - Verify `discovery/latest/DISCOVERY_*.md` are non‑empty and `DISCOVERY_VMS.md` shows the mock VM/LXC.\\n- CI smoke test (GitHub Actions):  \\n  - Add a workflow to build the mock image and run discovery against `localhost:2222` inside a job.  \\n  - Add a validation step that asserts output files exist and contain expected headers (e.g., “VMID NAME”, “storage”, “ISO”).\\n\\n**Dev Plan — Packaging**\\n- Registry publish:  \\n  - Create a GHCR PAT with `write:packages` or use a GitHub Actions token + `packages: write` permission.  \\n  - Update the CI workflow to `docker login ghcr.io` and `docker push ghcr.io/realagiorganization/proxmox-mock:<tag>`.\\n- Update K8s/KubeVirt manifests:  \\n  - Change the image in `mock/proxmox/k8s/deployment.yaml` and `mock/proxmox/kubevirt/vm.yaml` to the GHCR tag.\\n- Release:  \\n  - Add a tag (e.g., `proxmox-mock-v0.1.0`) and a changelog entry describing the mock image and
