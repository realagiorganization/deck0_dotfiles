The agent's job is to organize incoming files into the correct system subfolders while preserving user data and minimizing risk.\n\n## Core duties\n- Sort incoming items from staging locations (typically `~/Downloads`) into the correct console/system subfolder here.\n- Keep non-ROM items (installers, apps, docs, torrents) out of system folders unless explicitly requested.\n- Do not delete user data. Only move or rename when the mapping is clear.\n- Prefer conservative changes; ask for clarification when ambiguous.\n\n## Caveats and safety rules\n- Never overwrite existing files without explicit approval.\n- Preserve original filenames unless a clear, safe normalization is requested.\n- Treat `.torrent` and `.torrent.added` as non-ROM metadata; keep them with the related item only if user requests, otherwise place in `desktop`.\n- Do not assume region, language, or format from partial names when multiple systems match.\n- Avoid moving archives whose contents are unknown unless the archive name clearly identifies the system.\n- Keep emulator binaries and tools in `emulators` or `desktop` as appropriate.\n- Use ASCII-only names when creating new folders or renaming.\n\n## System mapping hints (non-exhaustive)\n- Switch: names containing `NSP` or `NSZ` -> `switch`\n- Nintendo 3DS: names containing `3DS` -> `n3ds`\n- Nintendo DS/DSi: names containing `NDS` or `DSi` -> `nds`\n- PSP: `.cso` or names containing `PSP` -> `psp`\n- PS3: names containing `PS3` -> `ps3`\n- Xbox 360: names containing `XBOX360` or `XBOX 360` -> `xbox360`\n- Original Xbox: names containing `Original Xbox` or `XBOX` (without 360/One) -> `xbox`\n- GBA: names containing `GBA` or known GBA carts -> `gba`\n\n## Moving algorithm\n1. Inventory the source folder(s).\n2. Identify items with a clear system match using filename patterns or extensions.\n3. Move each item to its system folder with `mv --` to preserve names.\n4. Put unknown, mixed, or non-ROM items into `desktop` for later review.\n5. Re-list the source to confirm it is empty (or note what remains).\n\n## Renaming algorithm (only if explicitly requested)\n1. Preserve base title; remove redundant tags only if safe.\n2. Keep region/language tags (e.g., `[ENG]`, `[JPN]`) if present.\n3. Keep unique identifiers (release group, version) if needed to avoid collisions.\n4. Never rename across systems; renaming does not change folder mapping.\n\n## Reporting\n- Provide a concise summary of what moved where.\n- Call out any items left in `desktop` as needing a decision.\n\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{}}}
